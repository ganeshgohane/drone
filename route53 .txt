### http website hosted by dns  ###

--> launch an ec2-instanace and provide port 80  then purchase domain from freeenom.com 
--> then goto route53 service then create hosted zone then provide domain name where purchase from registar (freenom)
--> then hosted zone will automatic create NS and SOA and then goto freenom account click on client frenoom provide mail id passwd 
--> then click on my domain then click on manage domian and then click on management tool select nameserver
--> then privide enrty of any two nameserver of hosted zone  then chage it 
--> then create record of cname then record name = www.  & record type = CNAME & values = domain name  then simply create 
--> then type domain name on browser it will be work and for CNAME type www.domain name on browser it will be work. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     ##   ssl certifiaction and https website hosting in Route53  (secure https hosting) ##  

--> launch an ec2-instnace and provide port (http:80) & (https:443)  then purchase domain from freeenom.com 
--> then goto route53 service then create hosted zone then provide domain name where purchase from registar (freenom)
--> then hosted zone will automatic create NS and SOA and then goto freenom account click on client frenoom provide mail id passwd 
--> then click on my domain then click on manage domian and then click on management tool select nameserver
--> then privide enrty of any two nameserver of hosted zone  then change it 
--> then create record of cname then record name = www.  & record type = CNAME & values = domain name  then simply create 
--> then type domain name on browser it will be work and for CNAME type www.domain name on browser it will be work. 
--> then delete (A) record & CNAME Record from hosted zone then then 
--> then goto Certificate manager service then simply create request then public
-->then click domain and select DNS and then create
--> then create CNAME record-->record name = CNAME name cpy from certificate(goto Certificate manager); 
--> CNAME value = CNAME value cpy from certificate (goto Certificate manager).
-->then simply create record.
--> create target group with http:80 and add website on it path is blank include as pending as select ec2 ,
--> then create loadbalancer with listener https & select certificate and then create loadbalncer,
--> then hit DNS -name on browser with https:// but it will not secure 
--> then create (A) records select allow alias, select endpoint, select region, select loadbalncer,
--. then simply create record 
--> then hit domain name on browser with https://domain name
--> then it will be work website will secure . 

    ### creation of Route policy ##

step.1-->create ec2 -instance on ohio region with hosting website gyme template and create ec2 instnace on mumbai region with hosting 
webiste Hangover template then create hosted zone and then gives entry in fenoom register of NS paste an 2 NS then save chage and
with A record gives entry of ip Mumbai Region website in value portion with select ipv4 A record and simply create. 
then hit the domain name in browser it will hosted mumbai region i website Hangover.
create health check formumbai region website which is use to create of policy then remove A record and
             

1) failure policy (Route the traffic by using active passive server like 1 fail server and another server will run website easily)
--> follow step.1  
---> then create policy with name failure policy then -> then connect to failover rule & select heath check->then connect to endpt &
 select value & IP of M.R. then automatic select of secondary -->then select value & IP of O.R.
---> then create polic and record at a time then it give A record values
--> then run cmd thorugh cli on mumbai region instance --> systemctl stop httpd and check there status also
--> then hit dns on browser it will show ohio region website automatically 

 
2) weghtedned policy (Route traffice by using no. of multiple servers or resources with provide avarage policy (80 & 20))
--> follow step.1
-->then create policy with name weightend policy then -> then connect to wegihtened rule=80  & select heath check->then connect to endpt &
 select value & IP of M.R. then automatic select of secondary then connect to wegihtened rule=20 -->then select value & IP of O.R.
---> then create policy and record at a time then it give A record values
--> then run cmd thorugh cli on mumbai region instance --> amazon-linux-extras install epel -y and yum install stress & stress --help)
 increasing cpuutilazition manually) stress --cpu 80 --io 4 --vm 2 --vm-bytes 128M --timeout 1m
--> then hit dns on browser it will show ohio region website automatically 

3) Geolocation routing policy (Route traffice in  user location like another country and india countr region)
--> follow step.1
-->then create policy with name Geolocation policy then -> then connect to geolocation rule  & select heath check->then connect to endpt &
 select value & IP of M.R. then automatic select of secondary then connect to geolocation rule select default location 
-->then select value & IP of O.R.
---> then create policy and record at a time then it give A record values
--> then using two browser 1st is opera meni and second your broswer 
--> then hit dns on opera mini browser with change broswer loaction using vpn it will show ohio region website will access easily.
--> then hit dns on opera mini browser it will show Mumabai region wesite will access easily.


4) Geoproximity routing policy (Route traffic sepcific area,region only)
--> follow step.1
-->then create policy with name Geolocation policy then -> then connect to geolocation rule  & select heath check->then connect to endpt &
 select value & IP of M.R. then automatic select of secondary then connect to geolocation rule select ohio region location 
-->then select value & IP of O.R.
---> then create policy and record at a time then it give A record values
--> then using two browser 1st is opera meni and second your broswer 
--> then hit dns on opera mini browser with change broswer loaction using vpn it will show ohio region website will access easily.
--> then hit dns on opera mini browser it will show Mumabai region wesite will access easily.

 
5) simple route policy --> (hosted wesite with single domain resources)
--> launch an ec2-instnace and provide port 80  then purchase domain from freeenom.com 
--> then goto route53 service then create hosted zone then provide domain name where purchase from registar (freenom)
--> then hosted zone will automatic create NS and SOA and then goto freenom account click on client frenoom provide mail id passwd 
--> then click on my domain then click on manage domian and then click on management tool select nameserver
--> then privide enrty of any two nameserver of hosted zone  then chage it 
--> then create record of cname then record name = www.  & record type = CNAME & values = domain name  then simply create 
--> then type domain name on browser it will be work and for CNAME type www.domain name on browser it will be work. 

6) multivalues routing policy (Route traffic by using select 8 records)

7) latency route policy record (Route traffic by using edeged location with time cosumption of round-trip time policy)
